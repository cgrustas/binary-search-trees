# Binary Search Trees

A JavaScript implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) data structure with comprehensive operations and traversal algorithms. Built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Description

This project implements a balanced BST that maintains sorted, non-duplicate numbers in a tree structure, enabling efficient O(log n) operations for insertion, deletion, and search. The implementation provides both iterative and recursive approaches for breadth-first and depth-first traversals.

## Learning Outcomes

By implementing common BST operations from scratch, I developed an intuitive understanding of its time/space complexities. I can visualize the search index halving at each tree level, and understand precisely why a search can be completed in O(log n) time. This foundation will inform my future decisions about how/when to use BSTs, and how to adapt them for different applications (i.e. storing more complex data in each Node). This project helped me translate my theoretical understanding of a BST to a concrete development setting.
